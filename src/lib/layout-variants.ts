// =============================================================================
// Section layout variants: the designed column counts and media sides
// (Appearance controls, Wave 3, 2026-08-28)
// =============================================================================
// ONE source of truth for the "how is this section laid out" controls, the way
// src/lib/surfaces.ts is the one source for how it is coloured. Read by three
// kinds of caller that must never drift:
//
//   1. the grid blocks in src/components/blocks/ — they ask for a class string
//      and put it on the grid element, nothing else,
//   2. src/sanity/schemaTypes/blocks.ts — the Studio radio list and the stored
//      default both come from here, so the list an editor sees and the classes
//      the site emits can never disagree,
//   3. src/lib/layout-variants.test.ts — asserts the fallback of every entry
//      emits the class string that block rendered BEFORE this file existed.
//
// THE PARITY RULE, and why this file is shaped the way it is. Four blocks
// already had a `columns` field with three hand-written class maps, and no two
// of those maps were the same: a four-across gallery starts two-up on a phone,
// four-across stats start two-up as well but skip the lg step, and four-across
// cards stay one-up until sm. Collapsing them into one formula would have been
// a visual change on live pages. So this is a REGISTRY, keyed by block type,
// holding each block's real classes verbatim. Nothing here is derived.
//
// Every `fallback` below is the value that block already defaulted to, and its
// entry in `classes` is that block's existing class string character for
// character. A section already in the dataset therefore renders byte-identical
// HTML; scripts/page-parity.mjs is what holds that line.
//
// MOBILE IS NEVER THE VARIABLE, and it is asserted rather than assumed. Each
// entry records the block's own base grid class (`baseColumns`) and what a
// 320px phone therefore resolves to (`phoneColumns`); the test replays the two
// together for EVERY option and fails if any option lands somewhere else. That
// is what lets the Playwright reflow sweep over the live pages stand in for the
// non-default values: no column choice can change what a phone renders, so
// there is no untested 320px layout hiding behind a radio button.
