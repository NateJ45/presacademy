# Module Library

All 13 modules are listed below. Each is OFF by default in the starter; enable
only the ones a given client needs by following the steps in the module's
enable doc. **`events` and `sermons` are enabled in this starter.**

For the shared folder-shape contract and the verify loop, see
`modules/README.md`.

## Presets

These combinations cover the most common project types and work well together
out of the box.

**Creative-studio pair:** enable `portfolio` + `process` for a design, photo,
or architecture studio. Together they give visitors a browsable project gallery
and a transparent look at how you work.

**Capture preset:** `newsletter` + `lead-magnets` + `resources` (optionally add
`style-quiz` and/or `budget-calculator`) for a lead-generation site. The three
core modules build a mailing list and a downloadable-guide library; the two
optional additions offer interactive qualification tools.

## Module details

### events

Adds a church or organization events system. The index lists upcoming one-time
events plus the weekly/recurring rhythms, with a static fallback list so the
page is never empty before Sanity is connected. Each event has its own detail
page with schedule, location, an optional image, a Portable Text description, an
optional registration link, and Event JSON-LD. Introduces two schemas
(`eventsPage` singleton, `event` collection supporting both recurring and
one-time events). Enabled in this starter.

Routes: `/events` (index), `/events/[slug]` (detail)

---

### sermons

Adds a sermons/media section. The index shows a featured latest message, an
archive grid, and a persistent Watch Live link, with a graceful "watch online"
fallback when empty. Each sermon has a detail page with an embedded
YouTube/Vimeo player, date/speaker/series/scripture, optional audio, and notes.
Two schemas (`sermonsPage` singleton, `sermon` collection). Enabled on the
starter.

Routes: `/sermons` (index), `/sermons/[slug]` (detail)

---

### portfolio

Adds a browsable project gallery. Visitors can filter by category and view
individual project detail pages. Optionally includes a before/after comparison
page. Introduces two schemas (`portfolioPage` singleton, `project` collection)
and four components (`PortfolioCursor`, `PortfolioFilterChips`, `ProjectGallery`,
`ProjectMetaBand`).

Routes: `/portfolio` (index), `/portfolio/[slug]` (detail), `/portfolio/before-after`

---

### process

Adds a "how I work" page composed of draggable process steps managed in Studio.
Steps use the orderable-document-list plugin so editors control display order
without touching code. Introduces two schemas (`processPage` singleton,
`processStep` orderable collection).

Route: `/process`

---

### newsletter

Adds a global email signup widget intended to be embedded in other pages (footer,
sidebar, inline CTAs) rather than occupying a dedicated route. Has no schemas of
its own; it relies on the `subscribe.ts` helper already in the core and the
mailing-list integration configured in `siteSettings`.

Route: none (embedded component only)

---

### lead-magnets

Adds a downloadable guides library. The index page lists all available guides;
each guide has its own detail page with a gated-download form powered by the
`LeadMagnetForm` component. Introduces one schema (`leadMagnet` collection).

Routes: `/guides` (index), `/guides/[slug]` (detail)

---

### style-quiz

Adds an interactive style-preference quiz that helps visitors discover their
design aesthetic and optionally captures their email for follow-up. The quiz
logic lives in the `StyleQuiz` React island. Introduces one schema
(`styleQuiz` singleton for copy and result descriptions).

Route: `/quiz`

---

### budget-calculator

Adds an interactive project budget estimator. Visitors answer a series of
questions and receive an estimated investment range. The calculator logic lives
in the `BudgetCalculator` React island. Introduces one schema
(`budgetCalculator` singleton for copy, question prompts, and price ranges).

Route: `/calculator`

---

### shop

Adds a product or digital-goods listing page. Items are managed as `shopItem`
documents grouped into `shopCollection` documents. Introduces three schemas
(`shopPage` singleton, `shopCollection`, `shopItem`) and two components
(`ShopGrid`, `ShopItemCard`).

Route: `/shop`

---

### e-design

Adds a service landing page for e-design or virtual interior design offerings.
Content is managed via the `eDesignPage` singleton. Has no collection schema or
interactive components beyond what is already in the core.

Route: `/e-design`

---

### gift-certificates

Adds a gift certificate landing page where visitors can purchase a certificate
or submit an inquiry. Content is managed via the `giftPage` singleton.

Route: `/gift-certificates`

---

### press

Adds a press and media coverage listing. Coverage items are managed as `pressItem`
documents and displayed on the `pressPage` singleton. Introduces two schemas
(`pressPage` singleton, `pressItem` collection).

Route: `/press`

---

### resources

Adds a curated resource or link library for clients. Content is managed via the
`resourcesPage` singleton (individual resource links are inline fields, not a
separate collection schema). Has no interactive components beyond core layout.

Route: `/resources`
