## Page architecture

### Routes

The starter ships these routes. Each is backed by a Sanity page singleton (content editable, structure in code), except the dated detail pages (collection-driven) and the generic `page` type.

| Path | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | `src/pages/index.astro` | Home singleton; hero + optional dated `seasonalHero` + "This Sunday" |
| `/about` | `src/pages/about.astro` | About singleton |
| `/worship` | worship singleton | "I'm New" / plan-a-visit page |
| `/what-we-believe` | beliefs singleton | Statement of faith is reproduced verbatim (leadership-owned) |
| `/music` | music singleton | |
| `/pastor-staff` | staff singleton + `staffMember` | |
| `/grow`, `/serve`, `/kids`, `/food` | per-page singletons | Get-involved / ministry pages |
| `/events` | `src/pages/events/index.astro` | Events index + `event` collection (incl. the Special Services band) |
| `/events/[slug]` | `src/pages/events/[slug].astro` | Event detail |
| `/sermons` | `src/pages/sermons/index.astro` | Sermons index + `sermon` collection + persistent Watch Live link |
| `/sermons/[slug]` | `src/pages/sermons/[slug].astro` | Sermon detail |
| `/use-our-space`, `/weddings` | per-page singletons | + inquiry `form` |
| `/give` | giving singleton | |
| `/faq` | `src/pages/faq.astro` | FAQ singleton + `faqItem` collection |
| `/contact` | `src/pages/contact.astro` | Contact singleton + `form` |
| `/privacy`, `/accessibility`, `/404` | privacy + accessibility singletons (each with a complete static fallback); custom 404 | |
| `/<slug>` | `src/pages/[slug].astro` | Generic `page` type -- editor-built pages from the block library (reserved-slug guard; zero pages = zero routes) |

The interior-designer starter's opt-in modules (portfolio, journal, shop, e-design, etc.) are NOT active in this build; their docs under `docs/modules/` remain for template reuse only.

### Page structure

Each page is a Sanity singleton whose built-in copy and images are editable fields (with verbatim fallbacks, so the page reads correctly before anything is entered), plus auto-populated content from collections (courses, faculty, events, FAQ items). The layout of each page is fixed in code; the words, images, page-builder section order, and backgrounds are editable.

> **Editability caveat (2026-06-14).** The lay-school rebuild reused the church schemas, so not every section is editable yet, and Studio shows some orphan church-era fields. `content-editability-audit.md` is the ground-truth map of what is editable vs. hardcoded per page. The **home** and **about** pages were the worst offenders (most sections were hardcoded literals) and were re-schema'd this session: their built-in sections (home: wayfinding / stats / topics ticker / strip eyebrow-heading pairs / hero button labels / next-cohort label; about: mission / beliefs / how-we-teach / why / faculty-band) are now editor-driven Sanity fields with the literals as inline fallbacks, and `scripts/seed-page-copy.mjs` populated them so Studio mirrors the live site. Detail pages (course / faculty / event) also now render previously-orphaned fields (course syllabus download + seats note; faculty specializations / years / email; event all-day). Structural section labels ("At a glance", "Degrees", etc.) and the catalog/faculty filter legends are intentionally left hardcoded. **Update 2026-06-15:** the remaining dataset gaps were then closed by `scripts/seed-editability.mjs` (closing-CTA bands seeded on every page singleton, the missing contact/privacy/accessibility/404/events singletons + the faqItem/event collections created, 39 -> 63 docs); `content-editability-audit.md` has the current status.

**The page builder.** Every page singleton -- plus the generic `page` type -- has a `flexibleSections[]` array rendered by `Sections.astro`. Editors add / reorder / remove on-brand blocks (rich text, image+text, cards, quote, CTA band, form, feature cards, stats, FAQ, gallery, media showcase (slideshow/video), steps, logos, media feature, dynamic list incl. testimonials, resources/downloads, key dates, tuition tiers), each with a background control (brand tone, or image/video + readability overlay) via `SectionShell.astro`. They render below a page's built-in content and are empty by default, so nothing changes until used. Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-01-page-builder-expansion-design.md`.

**Built-in content + closing CTA.** A page renders its bespoke built-in sections (hero, then the page's content fields), then any `flexibleSections`, then a `<FinalCta>` whose eyebrow / headline / subhead are editable per page. The home page additionally supports the dated `seasonalHero` override and a "This Sunday" block.

**Background cadence.** Built-in sections alternate `bg-background` / `bg-muted`, with deep chapel-green bands for the utility/CTA surfaces, so adjacent sections don't share a surface. Page-builder sections set their own background via the block's background control.

### Empty-content behavior (no module toggles)

**Sanity is the single source of truth for all content** (see `editor-vs-hardcoded.md`): every content field is populated, so the Studio mirrors the live site, and the inline strings in the templates are only a safety net. This build also does not use the starter's `sectionVisibility` module-toggle system -- there are no opt-in module sections to gate. Content degrades gracefully on its own:
- **Empty fields fall back** to the built-in verbatim copy (the inline-fallback safety net), so a section can never go blank if a field is cleared. Fields are populated by default, so the Studio shows the live copy rather than a blank input.
- **Empty collections degrade** (e.g. `/sermons` shows a "watch online" state with the live link when no sermons are posted; an empty FAQ category simply doesn't render; an announcement only shows when enabled and within its date window).
- **Page-builder sections** are opt-in by nature: a page with no `flexibleSections` just shows its built-in content.

(If you later enable a starter module, its `docs/modules/` doc documents the visibility toggle that gates it.)

### Header + footer nav

The header menu and the footer link columns are **editor-driven** (`siteSettings.navItems` and `siteSettings.footerColumns`), with the built-in `FALLBACK_NAV_ITEMS` in `Header.astro` and the default columns in `Footer.astro` rendering only when those fields are empty. See `editor-vs-hardcoded.md`.

**The header utility bar carries live enrollment status.** Above the nav row, `Header.astro` queries the soonest upcoming term (`getNextTerm()`) and shows "Now enrolling · {term} begins {date}" with a pulsing `.enroll-dot` linking to `/courses`, alongside tap-to-call, a "Request info" link, and the theme toggle. When no term is scheduled it falls back to `settings.tagline`. The line collapses to a short form on mobile (term title only, phone/city hidden). Cream on the deep green band, both themes.

**The footer is a printed-book colophon.** `Footer.astro` is composed as a colophon page: an oversized Fraunces wordmark masthead + mission + two CTAs; an imprint row (where-we-meet/contact, the editor-managed nav index, follow-along, each under a brass eyebrow rule); a funding-acknowledgment line driven by `siteSettings.funder` ("Made possible by the {funder}"); and a colophon bar (a "PA" monogram seal, locality + denomination, the "Set in Fraunces & Source Sans 3" typeface credit, copyright, legal links, designer credit). See `components.md` for the full breakdown.

The desktop nav is **server-rendered** in `Header.astro`: flat items are real `<a>` tags, dropdown groups are native `<details>`/`<summary>` disclosures with child links as real `<a>` tags inside. Everything is in the server HTML at build time, so crawlers see every internal link and there is no flash-of-missing-nav (or CLS) before JS runs. A small progressive-enhancement `<script>` layers on open-on-hover, close-on-outside-click, close-on-Escape, and close-on-navigation (re-bound on `astro:page-load`; document-level listeners guarded by `window.__headerNavBound` so they don't stack across View Transitions). The nav works with JS disabled.

**Do NOT regress the desktop nav to a client-only island.** An earlier pattern hydrated a `NavDropdowns.tsx` React island with `client:only="react"`, which left the ENTIRE desktop nav out of the server HTML -- bad for SEO and CLS. Keep the flat links and the group structure SSR'd; use an island only for the open/close interaction if it is ever needed.

**The nav shape.** `Header.astro` maps each Sanity `navItems` entry (a Link or a Dropdown menu) into `{ kind: 'flat' }` / `{ kind: 'dropdown', items: [...] }` and shares that with `MobileNav.tsx`, so desktop and mobile stay in sync (the mobile drawer inherits the same menu). `<summary>` triggers carry `.nav-underline` and get `aria-current="page"` (which locks the underline wide) when one of their children is the active route.

**Header breakpoint is `lg:` (1024 px), not `md:` (768 px).** Between md and lg the nav + CTA cram against the wordmark and visibly squish it; bumping the breakpoint means tablet/narrow-laptop widths use the centered-logo + hamburger layout, and the desktop layout appears only once there is room for it.
